    <h1>Neuroaesthetics: the Brain and Art</h1>
    <h3><a href="index.html">Homepage</a></h3>

    <p>Neuroaesthetics is a topic that has been explored in the last few decades, and formally recognized at the turn of this century. The field aims to explore the relationship between the brain and art, whether it be visual, auditory, or the other forms of perception, and explain why art can be so appealing. The brain areas that correlate to neuroaesthetics are the prefrontal cortex and the orbito-frontal cortex. Both negative and positive input activate these two brain areas, so we understand this activation to happen in order to measure not whether the brain enjoys the input but how much. </p>

    <p>When you think of abstract art, most think of randomness with shapes, color, and other things from the recesses of our subconscious. However, in an experiment conducted by Angelina Hawley-Dolan at Boston College, she proves that this form of art may not be as random as you may think. In her experiment, participants were presented with two pieces of art and told to choose between the two. The art pieces presented came from famous artists, chimpanzees, and children. One third of them were labelled, but not always with the correct label. Despite the anonymity of the pieces, participants tended to choose artwork from famous artists, even if it was labelled to be created by a chimpanzee or a toddler.  In another experiment, Robert Pepperell and Alumit Ishai used eye-tracking to measure how people looked at the composition of colors and shapes of an original work, and compared that length to the length of looking at a rearranged version. They found that people tended to linger the same places when observing art. However, when the art piece was altered, such as by rotation, participants eye movements were quicker, did not linger in specific places, and were said to be less enjoyable. Based on the results of these experiments, we can conclude that creating acceptable art is not just a random process, but requires specific skills. The seemingly randomness of this art is a result of intentional actions, and these artists have the special skills and eye to create art that is pleasing to the public.</p>



    <p>The composition of the art is very exact in the sense that it truly does produce the most human engagement and pleasure. But how is such a thing measured? One experiment measured the complexity of an art piece by calculating the number of bits needed to store the information that represented the piece of art. The more bits needed means that more memory is needed to store the painting in the computer, therefore making it measurably more complex. This information, combined with the findings that the compositions of  abstract art is intentional, found that many famed artists hit a “sweet spot” in that their works by not being  too simple, and not too complicated. In another study conducted by Pepperell and Ishai, they found that there is “widespread neural activity” in the brain when observing art and asked questions about the art. Participants were asked if they could find anything recognizable in the art, whether intended or not. In the delays of answering the question, fMRI scans proved the brain is very active, similar to as if the brain is trying to solve a puzzle. Based on this study, art can be stimulating to brain not only because it looks nice, but because our brain tries to categorize the stimuli into something recognizable. Hitting the sweet spot between simple and complicated is what captivates our attention.</p>



    <p>Through exploring abstract artists, we gain a greater understanding of neuroaesthetics. The swirls and dashes of color on Pollocks large canvases appear to be completely random, and have been criticized because it seems as if people only pretend to appreciate abstract art because it is trending. </p>



    <p>Pollock in particular is an interesting example because of his unique style of swirling and sweeping colors through his dynamic method of using his entire body to get the paint on the canvas. His work might be interpreted through the activation of mirror neurons in the viewer’s brain they observe his work, as if the viewer is imagining Pollock’s movements while painting, which has been so beautifully captured on the canvas.</p>

    <p>As you look at this close up of Lavender Mist (1950), you see varying shapes across the image. There are skinny lines, fat blobs, zig zags, and splotches, all requiring different movements to create that shape. As you look at this image, your brain attempts to make sense of these shapes by imagining what motions were used to create this shape. Your mirror neurons, neurons active when mimicking actions, and motor neurons, which are associated with mirror neuron activity, are activated as your brain “reconstructs the energetic movements the artist used as he painted”, as said in the New Scientist article “Get the picture? Art in the brain of the beholder”. When I look at this piece, I imagine the skinny white lines as paint hitting the canvas at a relatively fast speed and at an angle. In contrast, I see the blue splotches as slower moving, coming from directly above the canvas. What may seem so chaotic can be stimulating and pleasing to your brain. </p>
