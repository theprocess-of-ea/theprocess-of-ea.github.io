    <p>Abstract art is a highly subjective style of art. Some people pay 
    millions of dollars to hang a piece in their home while others think of 
    it as something "anyone can do". Before starting this project, we were more 
    like the latter group, but we wanted to investigate this topic because of its 
    ties to the subconscious. Upon more research, both of us realized that perhaps 
    abstract art is not just a random collection of colors and shape, but a product 
    of intentionality. Ultimately, we came to research what creativity is, which is 
    the generation of new ideas. However, some people come better equipped with the 
    ability to generate new ideas based on brain structure and ability, creating 
    the innovation that we see as creative. With this in mind, our project aims to 
    investigate Pollock's way of creating art while also learning about abstract 
    art as a whole.</p>
