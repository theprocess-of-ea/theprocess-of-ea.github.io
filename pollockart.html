    <p>Autumn Rhythm (Number 30), 1950 by Jackson Pollock</p>
    </div>

    <p>Above are two of his most famous pieces: Autumn Rhythm, created in October of 1950, and Convergence, created in 1952. The dimensions are impressive, Autumn Rhythm standing at 8’9”x 17’3” and Convergence at 8’ x 13’, absolutely enveloping the viewer in their vastness. They also clearly exemplify Pollock’s famous “drip paint” process, in which he pours and splatters paint onto an unstretched canvas. Though seemingly random, Pollock did one color at a time. In Autumn Rhythm, he grounds it with the black paint first, and then builds off, layering it with different colors and movements that connote a mixture of “accident and control”, as well as light and dark, thick and thin, horizontal and vertical. As we look at these two paintings, we can imagine Pollock as he dances around the canvas, using his entire body to create this piece.

    We can see the above works as a culmination of his influences. First, it is a complete break from his traditional schooling of Regionalism. Second, the emphasis on the subconscious in surrealism takes center stage— as deliberate as Pollock’s painting was, he subdued conscious thought while creating these pieces. Third, like Rivera’s works, Pollock turned to large canvases, which had the power to pull the viewer in because of its size. Finally, the idea of the “all-over” technique from Lee Krasner presents itself— there is no central point of focus in the painting, and instead the focus is on the entire canvas.

    In our creation, we were inspired to emphasize movement and freedom in the process, as we splattered paint from all sides of the paper with paint brushes, spatulas, wood blocks, and our hands. While Pollock started with black, we started with yellow, and built from there with primary colors and then began mixing the colors.
