    <p> 
        Jackson Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming in 1912. Growing up, he and his family moved around all over the Southwest because his father was a land surveyor. He went on surveying trips with his father, on which he interacted with Native Americans. He later recounted that the Native American art he saw on those trips was a subconscious influence for his art. <br>

        As he grew older, he was influenced by many other art movements and ideas, eventually leading to the creation of his art style that shocked the art world. Perhaps one of first factors was his teacher at the Arts Student League, Thomas Hart Benton, an artist and core leader of the American Regionalist art movement. This era was marked by realistic depictions of rural America. Below is a famous work from the movement. </p>

    <p>Regionalism became a point of rebellion for Pollock, as he learned through his traditional art education that his style was quite the opposite of Benton’s, as his works became more and more abstract. His path was further defined by Pablo Picasso, a leader in the Cubism and surrealism movements. One idea behind surrealism is the suppressing of conscious thought during the process of making art, which Pollock took to heart for his later works. Many of Picasso’s works were reactions to current global issues and events, like the World Wars, the development of nuclear weapons, and the wave of Communism. Pollock followed suit. Below is one such example by Picasso— the painting depicts the horrors of the aftermath of war in the Spanish town of Guernica, which was bombed by Nazi planes during the Spanish Civil War. </p>

        Another notable artist who influenced his path was Diego Rivera, also known as the husband of Frida Kahlo. Also at the forefront of the Cubism and surrealism, Rivera was well-known for his mural paintings, which was a characteristic Pollock incorporated into his works, as seen in his enormous canvas paintings; his most famous ones were typically 8’ x 17’. 
        A final force that shaped his legacy was his wife, Lee Krasner. One of the few female artists featured in the Museum of Modern Art, her development of the “all-over” technique pushed Pollock to his famous “drip paint” technique.

    <P>Through understanding how his life was shaped, we have a deeper understanding of his art, as well as recognize that the creation of a breakthrough artist and a uniquely creative style is through the contributions of many people and ideas before him. Pollock’s legacy still stands, and is one that shook the art world so acutely that the heart of avant garde art shifted from Paris to New York. </P>
